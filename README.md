# Inventory Management App
## Introduction
Managing inventory can be a complex and tedious task for any business, but with the right tools, it can be simplified and streamlined. That's why we have developed a robust inventory management app using Django for the back end and React Native for the front end. This innovative app enhances efficiency and accuracy in inventory management, ensuring optimal organization of stock, reducing errors, and boosting productivity.

## Technologies
The Inventory Management App is built using the following technologies:

- Django Framework: Django is a powerful Python web framework that provides a clean and efficient way to develop web applications. It offers a wide range of built-in features, such as object-relational mapping (ORM), authentication, and routing, which make it suitable for building the back end of the inventory management app.

- React Native Framework: React Native is a popular JavaScript framework for building native mobile applications. It allows developers to write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android platforms. With React Native, we can create a user-friendly and responsive front end for the inventory management app.

## Features
The Inventory Management App includes the following key features:

- Inventory Tracking: Keep track of all your products and their quantities in real-time. The app provides a centralized database where you can easily add, edit, and remove items from your inventory.

- Barcode Scanning: Use the app to scan barcodes or QR codes to quickly add or update items in your inventory. This feature saves time and reduces manual data entry errors.

Stock Alerts: Set up custom stock alerts to receive notifications when the quantity of a particular product falls below a specified threshold. This helps prevent stockouts and enables timely reordering.

- Sales and Order Management: Manage sales and orders within the app. Keep track of customer orders, generate invoices, and update inventory quantities automatically as orders are fulfilled.

- Reporting and Analytics: Gain insights into your inventory performance with built-in reporting and analytics features. View sales trends, monitor stock turnover rates, and identify popular or slow-moving items.

## Installation and Setup
To set up the Inventory Management App locally, follow these steps:

3. Configure the database settings in the Django settings file to connect to your preferred database.
4. Migrate the database schema and populate it with initial data if required.
5. Start the Django server to run the back end.
6. Start the React Native development server to run the front end.
